I have always had a very keen interest for technology. Ever since i was a kid, i found myself very attracted towards computers and other digital devices. Back then, growing up in Nepal, we were lucky if we got to see a computer.
It wasn't until i was in 6th or 7th grade that our school was able to introduce a computer class once a week as part of the curriculum for all students. This was an hour long class with only theory taught on a black chalk board with no actual computers involved. Every other week, we had the oppurtunity for a lab session when we would get to see an actual computer. I remember those big white boxes. They may not seem very pleasing now, but at the time, they were a sight of pleasure. Well, to my eyes at least. Also, the OS we were running was MS-DOS. Yeah, that's right, no GUI. But it was still fun!

The day my father brought a computer home, i was so excited. But kids were not allowed to use it and that included me. I would come up with all sorts of excuses and plans to convince my mom to let me use the computer. Sometimes, if i did succeed, my mom would let me use it for about an hour or so, and of that 1 hour, i would have to spend atleast 20 minutes trying just to connect to the internet through dial up. Yes, Dial Up connection. Remember the sound....
Over time, this fascination grew into something deeper. 

After graduating from high school, i moved to United States and joined college on a mission to get a degree in Computer Science. But things did not work out as i had planned.

Over the years, i have worked mostly in the food and beverage industry. I have worked almost every role one can think of in a restaurant. The role that i enjoyed the most was as a Beverage Director / Sommelier. I also love reading and learning about wine and talking about it.

However, I have managed to keep my self in touch with technology a little because of my very curious nature and my love for buliding things. I love building things, doesn't matter what, but i have found that building gaming PCs is a ton of fun! (even though i am not a big fan of gaming)

I currently feel that i am at a point at my life where i am ready to chase after my dream again. 
I have come to really enjoy understanding how computers work and i would like to learn and embrace the beautiful art of software engineering.
